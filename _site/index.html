    <h2 class="featurette-heading">Apostolic Developments Inc. <span class="text-muted">is pioneering Tri-Part Health. We want to see people receive Jesus Christ and the healing and health that He brings in the restoration of all of creation.</span></h2>
    <br>
    <p class="lead">As St. Irenaeus said, "<em>The glory of God is man fully alive.</em>" We view our work as a prophetic journey of joyful discovery - "<em>Call to me and I will answer you and tell you great and unsearchable things you do not know</em>" (Jeremiah 33:3). God is revealing healing and health resources and making them available to searching people.</p>

    <p><em>May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your whole spirit, soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ (1Thessalonians 5:23).</em></p>

    <p>God created you "in His likeness."" You are a tri-part being: Spirit, Soul, and Body. Your spirit has three func-tions: communion, conscience, and wisdom. Your soul has three functions: mind, will, and emotions. Your body has three parts: flesh, blood, and bones. Holy Spirit releases God’s light in you to bring life – healing and health.</p>

    <p><em>For you have been born again, not of perishable seed, (sperma) but of imperishable, through the living and enduring word of God. (1 Peter 1:23).</em></p>

    <p>Before you are born again your spirit is a lot like an unfertilized egg. When God fills your spirit, you receive the seed (sperma) of God, and you come alive spiritually. The egg of your spirit begins to grow and radiate the light of God. As you grow spiritually, the light of God also comes into your soul: mind, will, and emotions and into your body bringing healing and health.</p>

    <p><em>Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come (2 Cor 5:17)</em></p>

    <p>In America western physicians with a compartmentalized rather than holistic worldview have become a net-work of medical specialists that treat you as if your spirit, soul, and body do not affect one another, as if they are not connected. One part of you affects all of you. Health or sickness in one part affects all of you. As a new crea-tion,, you are being transformed so that you live in wholeness of spirit, soul, and body. There is a lot to learn and experience in this.. It is a journey together with God.</p>

<div class="featurette" id="tri-part">
    <img class="featurette-image img-circle img-responsive pull-left" src="images/tripart.png" width="500" style="margin-top: 50px;">
    <h2 class="featurette-heading">The Tri-Part being <span class="text-muted">Spirit, Soul, and Body</span>
    </h2>
    <p class="lead"><em>God is light (1 John 1:5). God said, “Let there be light” (Genesis 1:3).</em></p>
    <br><br>
    <p>God’s light is in and through everything that He has created. Now, God is unfathomable and we aren’t trying to describe God in some kind of high and lofty theological way at all. No. We simply want to tell you what we are learning and experiencing. What we share here is about our journey. That said, we invite you to prayerfully have a look in hope for insights into healing and health.</p>

    <p>Jesus’ teachings do describe God as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit- TRIPART. In the bible God’s light is experienced as a heavenly brilliant white light, a “creative spiritual substance” that shines powerfully through all three members of the Godhead like a prism. Of course the Godhead is not a prism, but the image is really prophetic. When the light of God shines through the prism of the trinity, the Seven Spirits of God, the Seven Colored Rainbow, and Seven Heavenly Sounds manifest.</p>

    <h3>Seven Spirits</h3>
    <p>We want the <em>whole</em> ministry of the Holy Spirit, to minister <em>wholeness</em> to searching people. The Seven Spirits of God are: Spirit of the Lord, Spirit of Wisdom, Spirit of Understanding, Spirit of Counsel, Spirit of Might, Spirit of Knowledge, and the Spirit of the Fear of the Lord. We want to receive the healing and health that comes from the whole ministry of the Holy Spirit.</p>

    <h3>Seven Colors</h3>
    <p>There are Seven Colors of the rainbow that are aligned with the Seven Spirits of God: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Royal Blue, Indi-go, and Violet. The Seven Colors are prophetic. In ancient Israel the rainbow colors they are found on the breastplate of the High Priest. There is a color for each of the Twelve Tribes. The Book of Revelation tells us that the New Jerusalem, the City of God also has foundational colored gem stones. We want to receive the healing and health that God has released in and through the colors that He has created.</p>

    <h3>Seven Sounds</h3>
    <p>There are Seven Healing Frequencies that have been uncovered in the music of King David. These historical healing frequencies are the same ones used by David to bring healing and deliverance to King Saul on his lyre. The Seven Healing Frequencies are aligned with spe-cific parts of your body to bring healing. We want to receive the healing and heath that God has released in healing frequencies.</p>

    <h3>Healing Together</h3>
    <p>God is revealing more on healing based on His word, not new age, but prophetic insights. We want to bring everything to the min-istry of healing all that He is revealing. The Seven Spirits of God, Seven Colors of the Rainbow, and the Seven Healing Frequencies are unified in the “creative spiritual substance” of the light of God.</p>

    <p>Spirit of the Lord (Red), Spirit of Wisdom (Orange), Spirit of Understanding (Yellow), Spirit of Counsel (Green), Spirit of Might (Royal Blue), Spirit of Knowledge (Indigo), and the Spirit of the Fear of the Lord (Violet). Color (visible) and Sound (audible) are on the same fre-quency. God revealed and released heavenly music to King David. He tuned his kinnor (lyre) to 444 Hz. for worship and healing. A = 444 Hz is a healing, life giving key.</p>

    <p>Interestingly, Sir Isaac Newton discovered that refraction causes the dispersion of light into colors. He named seven colors, in sym-metry with the seven distinct notes in the Western musical scale. (Revelation 3:1, 4:5, 5:6)</p>

<div class="featurette" id="spirit">
    <img class="featurette-image img-circle img-responsive pull-right" src="images/spirit.jpg" width="500" style="margin-top: 57px;">
    <h2 class="featurette-heading"><span class="text-muted">You are </span>Spirit</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="lead"><em>May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your whole spirit, soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ (1Thessalonians 5:23).</em></p>
    <br><br><br>
    <p>God created you “in His likeness.” You are a tri-part being: Spirit, Soul, and Body. Your spirit has three functions: communion, conscience, and wisdom. Your soul has three functions: mind, will, and emotions. Your body has three parts: flesh, blood, and bones. Holy Spirit releases God’s light in you to bring life – healing and health.</p>

    <h3>You are born again</h3>

    <p><em>For you have been born again, not of perishable seed, (sperma) but of imperishable, through the living and enduring word of God. (1 Peter 1:23).</em></p>

    <p>Before you are born again your spirit is a lot like an unfertilized egg. When God fills your spirit, you receive the seed (sperma) of God, and you come alive spiritually. The egg of your spirit begins to grow and radiate the light of God. As you grow spiritu-ally, the light of God also comes into your soul: mind, will, and emotions and gives you healing and health.</p>

    <h4>You are spirit</h4>

    <h3>Communion</h3>

    <p><em>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen (2 Corinthians 13:14).</em></p>

    <p>God’s light fills your spirit. Holy Spirit makes your spirit healthy. Your spirit is designed to have an eternal relationship with God. It is designed to commune with God in revelation.</p>

    <h3>Conscience</h3>

    <p><em>I tell the truth in Christ, I am not lying, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Spirit… (Romans 9:1).</em></p>
    <p>God’s light will give you an inner sense of what is right or wrong. You will be led in healthy conduct, motives, and actions.</p>

    <h3>Wisdom</h3>
    <p><em>The wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy (James 3:17).</em></p>

    <p>The wisdom of God comes by revelation with the fruits of the spirit. Spiritual wisdom is not worldly wisdom. Worldly wisdom comes from the minds of men.</p>

<div class="featurette" id="soul">
    <img class="featurette-image img-circle img-responsive pull-left" src="images/soul.jpg" width="500">
    <h2 class="featurette-heading"><span class="text-muted">You are </span>soul
    </h2>
    <h3>Mind</h3>
    <p class="lead"><em>God gave you power, love and a sound (healthy) mind (2 Timothy 1:7).</em></p>
    <br><br>
    <p> When God’s light comes into your mind, it is renewed. Your mind is transformed. You think with Holy Spirit. Thinking with Holy Spirit builds a healthy mind. The health of your mind is directly connected to faith that leads to decisions and actions.</p>

    <p>Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will. (Romans 12:2)</p>

    <p>Dark and negative cultural influences militate against your healthy mind. Building a healthy mind means following the Holy Spirit into the promises of God. That means renewing your mind for receiving God’s blessings.</p>

    <h3>Will</h3>
    <p>God works in you to will (make healthy choices) and do His good pleasure (Philippians 2:13)
    When God’s light comes into your soul, God gives you a will to make spirit-led choices. Spirit-led choices align you with the will of God. When you’re will is aligned with God’s will, the light of the Spirit brings health to your soul. Holy Spirit brings light to your soul so that your will gradually develop a pattern of living in agreement with the will of God.</p>

    <h3>Emotions</h3>
    <p>The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. (Galatians 5:22)</p>
    <p>Holy Spirit provides the fruits of the Spirit. The fruits of the Spirit are not emotions, but they will impact your soul because they are connected to how you feel about life. How you feel about life is directly connected to your health. One of the most inspir-ing works of the Spirit is to fill your life with joy. Holy Spirit gives you the joy of Jesus so your joy may be full. The joy that Holy Spirit brings into your life doesn’t depend on circumstances. It’s something that God does when you are living the spirit-filled life. Joy is a fruit of the Spirit.</p>

<div class="featurette" id="body">
    <img class="featurette-image img-circle img-responsive pull-right" src="images/body.jpg" width="500">
    <h2 class="featurette-heading"><span class="text-muted">You are </span>Body</h2>
    <p class="lead">Your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God… (1 Corinthians 6:19)</p>

    <h4>Flesh</h4>
    <p>
      God created your body. Your body is designed to be filled with light. Holy Spirit inhabits your flesh, blood, and bones. You are an amazing creation designed by God for healing and health. Your brain has over 7 hundred million cells. Every second your brain does about 1 trillion computations. Every cell of your body contains six feet of DNA that tells you who you are and how to make more of you. If all of the six foot sections of DNA in your body were added together it would be eight billion miles long. It would reach from the earth to the sun and back again four hundred times. Your flesh was created by God to receive the light of God to bring healing and health.
    </p>

    <h4>Blood</h4>
    <p>
      For the life of the flesh is in the blood (Leviticus 17:11)
    </p>

    <p>
      God created you for life. It is in your blood. Your blood is fundamental to the function of every cell in your body. Your cells need food to survive, grow, and repair themselves to fulfill specific functions including reproduction.. Your blood transports cel-lular food to provide energy for the cells. Blood regulates acidity/alkalinity (pH), that and provides oxygen. It removes carbon dioxide and other waste products. It carries healthy vitamins and minerals. God created your blood to protect you; to fight in-fection. Your body was created with blood and that blood was designed to receive the light of God to bring healing and health.
    </p>

    <h4>Bones</h4>
    <p>
      The Lord will…strengthen your bones (Isaiah 58:11)
    </p>

    <p>
      God created your bones. Your bones give you structure, strength and protection. The Bible says “the life is in the blood”, but the life of the blood is in the bones. Your bones are a center for the production of blood cells. Inside your bones, bone marrow is producing red blood cells (needed to transport oxygen throughout the body). It is also where white blood cells (needed for the immune system), adipocytes (fat cells) and fibroblasts (needed to make connective tissue) are made. Your body has 206 bones to perform a variety of functions. They are constantly changing shape and composition to meet your body's needs. Holy Spirit releases the light of God, a “creative spiritual substance,” into your bones. One of the primary ways is through the words of love that are spoken to you. Light is released by loving words. Darkness is released by hateful words. When you hear good news it actually “makes the bones healthy.” Your bones are designed to receive the light of God to bring health and healing.

    <h2 class="featurette-heading"><span class="text-muted">This is your </span>healing
    </h2>
    <h4>Prayer</h4>
    <p class="lead">We employ Healing Prayer, Pulsed Electro Magnetic Frequencies, and Wholetones Healing Frequency Music for people who want to improve their lives. When people use any or all of these blessings, life gets better.</p>

    <p>
      Healing is “sozo” in Greek. It means salvation, which basically means being saved and restored to the wholeness of God’s order and well-being by the Holy Spirit. Healing is for every aspect of human life. That means healing of the spirit, soul, and body- the whole person and his environment. Jesus gave us the ministry of healing to restore people to health. Tri-Part employs Healing Prayer.
    </p>

    <img class="featurette-image img-circle img-responsive pull-right" src="images/healing-therapy.png" width="500">
    <h4>PEMF</h4>
    <p>
      Pulsed Electromagnetic Fields is needed for your health. The earth frequencies (0-30 Hz range) match the frequencies of your body, your mind, your tissues and your cells. In the beginning humanity walked on the earth for about 25 miles a day. Our bodies were connected to the frequency of the earth. Today we only walk about ¼ of a miles day and our bodies only get a fraction of the earth frequencies that we need for wellness. This huge change has affected your life.
    </p>

    <p>
      A PEMF device used 2 times a day for 8 minutes will energize your cells, increase circulation, oxygenation, hydration, detoxification, and better absorption of nutrients. Tri-Part employs the BEMER PRO SET, a PEMF device with Healing Prayer. Sessions include resting mat for full body, localized wrap or spot applicators enhance oxygen circulation for skin and internal tissue, cellular metabolism and well-being. The fourth application, facial LED light carries the same pulsed signal that we feel on the earth.
    </p>

    <h4>Wholetones</h4>
    <p>
      Wholetones Healing Frequency Music uses seven musical tones uncovered in the music of King David. These historical healing frequencies are the same ones used by David to bring healing and deliverance to King Saul on his lyre. Seven unique songs recorded in seven unique frequencies are aligned with specific parts of your body to bring healing. Seven discs include: Open Door (396Hz), Desert Sojourn (417Hz), The Key of David (444Hz), Transformation (528Hz), The Bridge (639Hz), Great Awakening (741Hz), The Majestic (852Hz). These healing tones may be the very ones that were given to King David by God Himself! Tri-Part employs Wholetones Healing Music Frequencies too. The three combined are a powerful blessing!
