    <br>
    <p class="lead"><em>Call to me and I will answer you and tell you great and unsearchable things you do not know" (Jeremiah 33:3).</em></p>

    <p>Apostolic Developments, Inc. is on a journey of discovery in healing and health.  It’s a journey into wholeness.  America’s medical doctors that have a western compartmentalized worldview rather than holistic worldview of humanity are a network of specialists.</p>

    <p>You are a New Creation in Christ called to appropriate the promised way of life. You have to renew your mind and think differently about your life; about healing and health. Appropriating the promises of life as a New Creation is a shift into wholeness. Wholeness is healing and health for your whole being: spirit, soul, and body. Health or sickness in one part of your being affects your whole being. As a New Creation you are being transformed to live in wholeness.</p>

    <p>St. Irenaeus said, "The glory of God is man fully alive." What does it mean for you to live “fully alive?” That’s the journey of discovery that we are on and we invite you to come along. That’s what we are about.</p>

    <h2 class="featurette-heading">The Tri-Part being <span class="text-muted">Spirit, Soul, and Body</span>
    </h2>
    <p class="lead"><em>God is light (1 John 1:5). God said, “Let there be light” (Genesis 1:3).</em></p>

    <p>God’s light is in and through everything that He has created. Now, God is unfathomable and we aren’t trying to describe God in some kind of high and lofty theological way at all. No. We simply want to tell you what we are learning and experiencing. What we share here is about our journey. That said, we invite you to prayerfully have a look in hope for insights into healing and health.</p>

    <p>Jesus’ teachings do describe God as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit- TRIPART. In the bible God’s light is experienced as a heavenly brilliant white light, a “creative spiritual substance” that shines powerfully through all three members of the Godhead like a prism. Of course the Godhead is not a prism, but the image is really prophetic. When the light of God shines through the prism of the trinity, the Seven Spirits of God, the Seven Colored Rainbow, and Seven Heavenly Sounds manifest.</p>

    <h3>Seven Spirits</h3>
    <p>We want the <em>whole</em> ministry of the Holy Spirit, to minister <em>wholeness</em> to searching people. The Seven Spirits of God are: Spirit of the Lord, Spirit of Wisdom, Spirit of Understanding, Spirit of Counsel, Spirit of Might, Spirit of Knowledge, and the Spirit of the Fear of the Lord. We want to receive the healing and health that comes from the whole ministry of the Holy Spirit.</p>

    <h3>Seven Colors</h3>
    <p>There are Seven Colors of the rainbow that are aligned with the Seven Spirits of God: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Royal Blue, Indigo, and Violet. The Seven Colors are prophetic. We want to receive the healing and health that God has released in and through the colors that He has created. Interestingly, Sir Isaac Newton discovered that refraction causes the dispersion of light into colors. He named seven colors, in symmetry with the seven distinct notes in the Western musical scale. (Revelation 3:1, 4:5, 5:6)</p>

    <h3>Seven Sounds</h3>
    <p>There are Seven Healing Frequencies that have been uncovered in the music of King David. These historical healing frequencies are the same ones used by David to bring healing and deliverance to King Saul on his lyre. The Seven Healing Frequencies are aligned with specific parts of your body to bring healing. We want to receive the healing and heath that God has released in healing frequencies.</p>

    <h3>Healing Together</h3>
    <p>God is revealing more on healing based on His word, not new age, but prophetic insights. We want to bring everything to the ministry of healing all that He is revealing. The Seven Spirits of God, Seven Colors of the Rainbow, and the Seven Healing Frequencies are unified in the “creative spiritual substance” of the light of God.</p>

    <p>Spirit of the Lord (Red), Spirit of Wisdom (Orange), Spirit of Understanding (Yellow), Spirit of Counsel (Green), Spirit of Might (Royal Blue), Spirit of Knowledge (Indigo), and the Spirit of the Fear of the Lord (Violet). Color (visible) and Sound (audible) are on the same frequency. God revealed and released heavenly music to King David. He tuned his kinnor (lyre) to 444 Hz. for worship and healing. A = 444 Hz is a healing, life giving key.</p>

		<!-- Third Featurette -->
<div class="featurette" id="spirit">
    <img class="featurette-image img-circle img-responsive pull-right" src="images/spirit.jpg" width="500" style="">
    <h2 class="featurette-heading"><span class="text-muted">You are </span>Spirit</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="lead"><em>May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your whole spirit, soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ (1Thessalonians 5:23).</em></p>

    <p>God created you “in His likeness.” You are a tri-part being: Spirit, Soul, and Body. Your spirit has three functions: communion, conscience, and wisdom. Your soul has three functions: mind, will, and emotions. Your body has three parts: flesh, blood, and bones. Holy Spirit releases God’s light in you to bring life – healing and health.</p>

    <h3>You are born again</h3>

    <p><em>For you have been born again, not of perishable seed, (sperma) but of imperishable, through the living and enduring word of God. (1 Peter 1:23).</em></p>

    <p>Before you are born again your spirit is a lot like an unfertilized egg. When God fills your spirit, you receive the seed (sperma) of God, and you come alive spiritually. The egg of your spirit begins to grow and radiate the light of God. As you grow spiritually, the light of God also comes into your soul: mind, will, and emotions and gives you healing and health.</p>

    <h3>Communion</h3>

    <p><em>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen (2 Corinthians 13:14).</em></p>

    <p>God’s light fills your spirit. Holy Spirit makes your spirit healthy. Your spirit is designed to have an eternal relationship with God. It is designed to commune with God in revelation.</p>

    <h3>Conscience</h3>

    <p><em>I tell the truth in Christ, I am not lying, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Spirit… (Romans 9:1).</em></p>
    <p>God’s light will give you an inner sense of what is right or wrong. You will be led in healthy conduct, motives, and actions.</p>

    <h3>Wisdom</h3>
    <p><em>The wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy (James 3:17).</em></p>

    <p>The wisdom of God comes by revelation with the fruits of the spirit. Spiritual wisdom is not worldly wisdom. Worldly wisdom comes from the minds of men.</p>

<div class="featurette" id="soul">
    <img class="featurette-image img-circle img-responsive pull-left" src="images/soul.jpg" style="width: 500px">
    <h2 class="featurette-heading"><span class="text-muted">You are </span>Soul
    </h2>
    <br>
    <p class="lead"><em>God gave you power, love and a sound (healthy) mind (2 Timothy 1:7).</em></p>
    <p>When God’s light comes into your mind, it is renewed. Your mind is transformed. You think with Holy Spirit. Thinking with Holy Spirit builds a healthy mind. The health of your mind is directly connected to faith that leads to decisions and actions.</p>

    <h3>Mind</h3>

    <p><em>Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will. (Romans 12:2)</em></p>

    <p>Dark and negative cultural influences militate against your healthy mind. Building a healthy mind means following the Holy Spirit into the promises of God. That means renewing your mind for receiving God’s blessings.</p>

    <h3>Will</h3>
    <p><em>God works in you to will (make healthy choices) and do His good pleasure (Philippians 2:13)</em></p>
    <p>When God’s light comes into your soul, God gives you a will to make spirit-led choices. Spirit-led choices align you with the will of God. When you’re will is aligned with God’s will, the light of the Spirit brings health to your soul. Holy Spirit brings light to your soul so that your will gradually develop a pattern of living in agreement with the will of God.</p>

    <h3>Emotions</h3>
    <p><em>The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. (Galatians 5:22)</em></p>

    <p>Holy Spirit provides the fruits of the Spirit. The fruits of the Spirit are not emotions, but they will impact your soul because they are connected to how you feel about life. How you feel about life is directly connected to your health. One of the most inspiring works of the Spirit is to fill your life with joy. Holy Spirit gives you the joy of Jesus so your joy may be full. The joy that Holy Spirit brings into your life doesn’t depend on circumstances. It’s something that God does when you are living the spirit-filled life. Joy is a fruit of the Spirit.</p>

<div class="featurette" id="body">
    <img class="featurette-image img-circle img-responsive pull-right" src="images/body.jpg" width="500" style="">

    <h2 class="featurette-heading"><span class="text-muted">You are </span>Body</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="lead"><em>Your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God… (1 Corinthians 6:19)</em></p>
    <br>
    <h3>Flesh</h3>
    <p>
      God created your body. Your body is designed to be filled with light. Holy Spirit inhabits your flesh, blood, and bones. You are an amazing creation designed by God for healing and health. Your brain has over 7 hundred million cells. Every second your brain does about 1 trillion computations. Every cell of your body contains six feet of DNA that tells you who you are and how to make more of you. If all of the six foot sections of DNA in your body were added together it would be eight billion miles long. It would reach from the earth to the sun and back again four hundred times. Your flesh was created by God to receive the light of God to bring healing and health.
    </p>

    <h3>Blood</h3>
    <p>
      <em>For the life of the flesh is in the blood (Leviticus 17:11)</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      God created you for life. It is in your blood. Your blood is fundamental to the function of every cell in your body. Your cells need food to survive, grow, and repair themselves to fulfill specific functions including reproduction.. Your blood transports cellular food to provide energy for the cells. Blood regulates acidity/alkalinity (pH), that and provides oxygen. It removes carbon dioxide and other waste products. It carries healthy vitamins and minerals. God created your blood to protect you; to fight infection. Your body was created with blood and that blood was designed to receive the light of God to bring healing and health.
    </p>

    <h3>Bones</h3>
    <p>
      <em>The Lord will…strengthen your bones (Isaiah 58:11)</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      God created your bones. Your bones give you structure, strength and protection. The Bible says “the life is in the blood”, but the life of the blood is in the bones. Your bones are a center for the production of blood cells. Inside your bones, bone marrow is producing red blood cells (needed to transport oxygen throughout the body). It is also where white blood cells (needed for the immune system), adipocytes (fat cells) and fibroblasts (needed to make connective tissue) are made. Your body has 206 bones to perform a variety of functions. They are constantly changing shape and composition to meet your body's needs. Holy Spirit releases the light of God, a “creative spiritual substance,” into your bones. One of the primary ways is through the words of love that are spoken to you. Light is released by loving words. Darkness is released by hateful words. When you hear good news it actually “makes the bones healthy.” Your bones are designed to receive the light of God to bring health and healing.
