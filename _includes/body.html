    <p class="lead"><em>Your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God… (1 Corinthians 6:19)</em></p>
    <br>
    <h3>Flesh</h3>
    <p>
      God created your body. Your body is designed to be filled with light. Holy Spirit inhabits your flesh, blood, and bones. You are an amazing creation designed by God for healing and health. Your brain has over 7 hundred million cells. Every second your brain does about 1 trillion computations. Every cell of your body contains six feet of DNA that tells you who you are and how to make more of you. If all of the six foot sections of DNA in your body were added together it would be eight billion miles long. It would reach from the earth to the sun and back again four hundred times. Your flesh was created by God to receive the light of God to bring healing and health.

    <h3>Blood</h3>
    <p>
      <em>For the life of the flesh is in the blood (Leviticus 17:11)</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      God created you for life. It is in your blood. Your blood is fundamental to the function of every cell in your body. Your cells need food to survive, grow, and repair themselves to fulfill specific functions including reproduction.. Your blood transports cellular food to provide energy for the cells. Blood regulates acidity/alkalinity (pH), that and provides oxygen. It removes carbon dioxide and other waste products. It carries healthy vitamins and minerals. God created your blood to protect you; to fight infection. Your body was created with blood and that blood was designed to receive the light of God to bring healing and health.
    </p>

    <h3>Bones</h3>
    <p>
      <em>The Lord will…strengthen your bones (Isaiah 58:11)</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      God created your bones. Your bones give you structure, strength and protection. The Bible says “the life is in the blood”, but the life of the blood is in the bones. Your bones are a center for the production of blood cells. Inside your bones, bone marrow is producing red blood cells (needed to transport oxygen throughout the body). It is also where white blood cells (needed for the immune system), adipocytes (fat cells) and fibroblasts (needed to make connective tissue) are made. Your body has 206 bones to perform a variety of functions. They are constantly changing shape and composition to meet your body's needs. Holy Spirit releases the light of God, a “creative spiritual substance,” into your bones. One of the primary ways is through the words of love that are spoken to you. Light is released by loving words. Darkness is released by hateful words. When you hear good news it actually “makes the bones healthy.” Your bones are designed to receive the light of God to bring health and healing.
