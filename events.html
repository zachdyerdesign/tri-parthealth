          <p class="lead"><em>We employ Healing Prayer, Pulsed Electro Magnetic Frequencies, and Wholetones Healing Frequency Music</em> for people who want to improve their lives. When people use any or all of these blessings, life gets better.</p>

          <h3>Tri-Part</h3>
          <p>TRIPART is a healing immersion experience. In addition to the teachings, all sessions will include the opportunity for you to experience Healing Prayer, a PEMF Session, and the Sound of Wholetones Healing Frequencies.</p>

          <h3>Prayer</h3>
          <p>Healing is “sozo” in Greek. It means salvation, which basically means being saved and restored to the wholeness of God’s order and well-being by the Holy Spirit. Healing is for every aspect of human life. That means healing of the spirit, soul, and body- the whole person and his environment. Jesus gave us the ministry of healing to restore people to health. Tri-Part employs Healing Prayer.</p>

          <h3>PEMF</h3>
          <p>Pulsed Electromagnetic Fields is needed for your health. The earth frequencies (0-30 Hz range) match the frequencies of your body, your mind, your tissues and your cells. A PEMF device used 2 times a day for 8 minutes will energize your cells, increase circulation, oxygenation, hydration, detoxification, and better absorption of nutrients. Tri-Part employs a PEMF device with Healing Prayer. Sessions include resting mat for full body, localized wrap or spot applicators enhance oxygen circulation for skin and internal tissue, cellular metabolism and well-being. The fourth application, facial LED light carries the same pulsed signal that we feel on the earth.</p>

          <h3>Wholetones</h3>
          <p>Wholetones Healing Frequency Music uses seven musical tones uncovered in the music of King David. These historical healing frequencies are the same ones used by David to bring healing and deliverance to King Saul on his lyre. Seven unique songs rec-orded in seven unique frequencies are aligned with specific parts of your body to bring healing. Seven discs include: Open Door (396Hz), Desert Sojourn (417Hz), The Key of David (444Hz), Transformation (528Hz), The Bridge (639Hz), Great Awakening (741Hz), The Majestic (852Hz). These healing tones may be the very ones that were given to King David by God Himself! Tri-Part employs Wholetones Healing Music Frequencies too. The three combined are a powerful blessing!</p>
